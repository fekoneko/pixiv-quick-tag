# Pixiv Quick Tag

A simple Firefox extension (add-on). It allows to quickly *add tags* to works on Pixiv without needing to leave the page.

After installation this simple menu will appear under each work:

- You can choose to add work to *public* or to *private* bookmarks
- You can enter your *custom tags* or *pin* frequently used ones
- When pressing *"Apply"* all previous tags will be overriden and the work will be bookmarked

---

- For now the extension doesn't display tags currently applied to the works
- The extension was viewed only on Pixiv's dark theme as I use one
